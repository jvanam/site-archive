			<p class="bodytext">Jess Vanam is a junior at Cornell University from Norwalk, CT majoring in Information Science. Their favorite pastimes are licking spoons and smelling snakes; their favorite color is the exact shade of pale gray of the worms that emerge after a good rainfall. Their biggest secret is <em>the zipper</em> at the base of their neck, which—when unzipped—reveals that they are actually composed of a human skin-suit filled entirely of 3,450 baby spiders. Their favorite dances are <em>rain</em>-dance, <em>sun</em>-dance, and <strong>thrash</strong> (in reverse order). They eagerly await the blessed day that the seven suns burn bright at high noon, and are grateful to have the company of their wonderful friends in the Cornell community to tide them over until then. </p>
