  <p class='description'>The Spiderbot is a toy prototype created for the Fall
    2017 course Info 4320 - Rapid Prototyping and Physical Computing. The
    Spiderbot is a mobile motion-controlled robot. Its primary function is to
    serve as a toy. Our goal was to create a toy with a contactless interface
    which translates bodily motion in space to visual output. There already
    exist many variations on remote-control toys and even contactless digital
    video games (for example, the Xbox Kinect) but there seems to be a lack of
    contactless physical toys with a solely creative (as opposed to goal-based)
    intent--this is what the Spiderbot aspires to be.</p>

  <p class='description'>Each leg of the Spiderbot is attached to a marker, so the
    movements of the userâ€™s hands create line art compositions. The control box and the robot
    (pictured above) are physically separated. </p>
