	      		Cayuga Lodge is a cooperative living association at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.
						We are non-profit, co-educational & fully student run & owned, independent
						of the university. Originally built in 1880 as Ezra Cornell’s carriage house and servant’s
						quarters, the house later became one of the first cooperative living
						institutions in the United States.
						<br> Today, the lodge houses 18-22 undergraduate and graduate students.
						Though not owned by Cornell, Cayuga Lodge is involved with the
						cooperative community at Cornell. Its welcoming and lively atmosphere, proximity
						to campus, and low cost are just a few of the reasons why
						students choose to live here.
