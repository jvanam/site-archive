    Jess Vanam is a junior at Cornell University from Norwalk CT USA majoring in
    Information Science. They are interested in Human-Computer interaction, and
    have worked at Cornell's Robots in Groups Lab as an undergraduate research
    assistant since June 2017. Their favorite pastimes are licking spoons and smelling
    snakes; their favorite color is the exact shade of pale gray of the worms
    that emerge after a good rainfall. Their biggest secret is the zipper
    at the base of their neck, which—when unzipped—reveals that they are actually
    composed of a human skin-suit filled entirely of 3,450 baby spiders. Their
    favorite dances are rain-dance, sun-dance, and thrash (in reverse order).
    They eagerly await the blessed day that the seven suns burn bright at high
    noon, and are grateful to have the company of their wonderful friends and family
    to tide them over until then.
